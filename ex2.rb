# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this, or even #!" #and the comment after is ignored
#but a '#'' inside a string will operate as a normal character, as it is considered a character not a comment, when inside "speech marks"


# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."
